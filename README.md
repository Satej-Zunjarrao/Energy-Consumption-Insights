# Energy-Consumption-Insights
Developed an analytics solution to identify household energy consumption patterns and recommend strategies for energy optimization.

# Energy Consumption Insights System

## Overview
The **Energy Consumption Insights System** is a Python-based solution designed to analyze household energy usage data. The system leverages advanced data wrangling, predictive analytics, statistical modeling, and visualization techniques to provide actionable insights for reducing energy costs and promoting sustainable consumption habits.

This project includes a modular and scalable pipeline for data collection, cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, predictive modeling, visualization, and automation.

## Key Features
- **Data Collection**: Gathers energy usage data from smart meters, SQL databases, and APIs.
- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocesses energy data by handling missing values and removing anomalies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifies trends, peak consumption times, and seasonal patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates derived features like average daily consumption and categorizes households into usage tiers.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Builds regression models to forecast energy usage and classification models to identify high-consumption households.
- **Visualization**: Exports processed data for Tableau and generates energy usage summaries.
- **Automation**: Automates data ingestion and model updates to ensure dashboards remain actionable.
